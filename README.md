 KeyLogger In CyberSecurity
 Key Logger logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard 
capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, 
typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that 
their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the 
person operating the logging program.
 Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers 
access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers 
you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. 
Steps Involved in KeyLogger Programme
 As we are doing KeyLogger Programme in python.
 Further KeyLogger Programmer involve the following steps:
 1) We had to import os, import pyxhook. It tells the keylogger where the 
log file will go.
 2) We will allow setting the cancel key key from environment args.
 3)We will allow clearing the log file on start, if pylogger_clean is 
defined.
 4)We will creating key pressing event and saving it into log file.
 5)We will create a hook manager object. Then, set the hook. We start the 
hook
 6)User cancelled from command line.
 7)Write exceptions to the log file, for analysis later.

The Security Concerns With Key Logger In 
CyberSecurity
 Most keyloggers can be kept at bay with a virus scanner and an up-to-date firewall. 
Of course, new keyloggers are constantly being developed and their signature is not 
immediately flagged by the protection programs as being harmful. So, how you 
behave when using your computer is also important if you want to minimize the risk 
of keylogging. We have put together some tips on how you can protect yourself from 
keyloggers.
 • Make sure your security software is up-to-date. Use high-performance antivirus 
programs and real-time scanners to protect yourself from keyloggers. Most 
keyloggers are found and removed by any reasonably good antivirus program. 
However, you should not scrimp on the quality of the software – especially if you 
regularly have to enter strictly confidential data such as account data on your 
computer.
 • Special password managers not only help you to get an overview of all your 
passwords, but also generate highly complex passwords that are difficult for 
keyloggers to log. In addition, these programs often have an autofill function, so 
you don’t have to enter your credentials manually. After all, keyloggers can 
usually only read what you actually type.
 • Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is considered extremely secure for login data. 
The user is not only prompted for a password, but also requires variable factor 
authentication (e.g. via a cell phone), which is usually interactive. Even if 
keyloggers crack the actual password, this is useless thanks to MFA alone.
 • Keylogger hardware is hardly ever used by private users. But if, for example, you 
work with highly confidential data at the office that might be of interest to 
competitors, it can’t hurt to check your connections from time to time. Be on the 
lookout for suspicious-looking connectors. If you think you are a victim of 
keylogger hardware, you should inform IT before removing the alleged 
keylogger.
 • There are special tools on the internet that can be used to find and remove 
keyloggers. The best known tool is Spybot – Search & Destroy which also offers 
quite a powerful free version. Another tried and tested program is Malwarebytes. 
Unlike more comprehensive antivirus programs, Spybot and Malwarebytes have 
been specially developed to fight malware that spies on your data – like 
keyloggers.
